REFLECTION:

1. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application? 

- A website is like an online page where you can read or view information and you just browse it to see announcements, articles, or pictures. While a web application is more interactive. You can log in, type something, click buttons, or do certain tasks. For example, Facebook or Google Classroom are web applications because you use them, not just read them. Meanwhile, a school website is more like a source of information only. 

2. Why do you think organizations (like offices or school) need websites?

- Organizations need websites because it makes information easier to access. For schools, websites can show announcements, class schedules, or events for students and parents. Also, in offices can use websites to post updates, services, or contact information. It helps people get what they need without always asking someone in person. Another reason is that websites are available anytime, even at night or during weekends. For me, having a website also makes the school or office look more professional.
