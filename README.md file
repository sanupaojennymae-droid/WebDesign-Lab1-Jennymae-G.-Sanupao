REFLECTION:

1. What is a website, and how is it different from a web application? 

- A website is like an online page where you can read or view information and you just browse it to see announcements, articles, or pictures. While a web application is more interactive. You can log in, type something, click buttons, or do certain tasks. For example, Facebook or Google Classroom are web applications because you use them, not just read them. Meanwhile, a school website is more like a source of information only. 

2. Why do you think organizations (like offices or school) need websites?

- Organizations need websites because it makes information easier to access. For schools, websites can show announcements, class schedules, or events for students and parents. Also, in offices can use websites to post updates, services, or contact information. It helps people get what they need without always asking someone in person. Another reason is that websites are available anytime, even at night or during weekends. For me, having a website also makes the school or office look more professional. 

3. What challenges did you encounter while creating your first respiratory?

- When I created my first repository, I honestly found it difficult at the start. I didn’t really understand how GitHub worked. It was kind of confusing because I was using GitHub on my phone. Sometimes I made mistakes and had to start over again. There were so many buttons and options on the website that I didn’t know what to click. But after exploring it for a while, I started to understand how it works.

4. How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?

- For me, making a README is super helpful because it serves as a simple guide for my project. It helps me and others understand what the project is about and how to use it. I can also use this skill in professional jobs, like in an office setting, where proper documentation is really important.
